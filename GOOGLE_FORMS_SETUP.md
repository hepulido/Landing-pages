# ✅ Google Forms Integration - ALREADY CONFIGURED!

## 🎉 Your Google Form is Already Connected!

I've already configured your landing page to work with your Google Form at:
[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHjs-Oz6zbyxL15WNd9yMg0jQvd-5m8OjvZPMEQa7p_uPhgA/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHjs-Oz6zbyxL15WNd9yMg0jQvd-5m8OjvZPMEQa7p_uPhgA/viewform)

## 🚀 What's Already Working:

✅ **Form Submission**: When users fill out the form on your landing page, the data is automatically sent to your Google Form

✅ **Success Message**: Users see a beautiful "Thank you for registering!" message after submission

✅ **Both Languages**: Works on both English (`/`) and Spanish (`/es`) versions

✅ **Error Handling**: If something goes wrong, users get a friendly error message

1. Go to your Google Form: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHjs-Oz6zbyxL15WNd9yMg0jQvd-5m8OjvZPMEQa7p_uPhgA/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHjs-Oz6zbyxL15WNd9yMg0jQvd-5m8OjvZPMEQa7p_uPhgA/viewform)
